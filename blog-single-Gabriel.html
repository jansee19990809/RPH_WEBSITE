                  <p class="text-justify">
                    The articles are the laws about the Filipino and foreign citizens and residents that are born inside and outside the Philippine territory and that must live for 2 years to be local or native citizen according to the Philippine laws. They also include laws of the individuals and groups being detained for crime and that they can be released or given a judicial authority in the next 24 hours following the act of detention and must not be imprisoned without a warrant made by the court.  
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    There are laws about the people from the inside and outside of the Philippines must enter other places of residents if there are urgent cases that exists in this country such as fire, floods and earthquakes, and if the virtue of an executory order exists. It also entails the correspondences sent to office that will not be withheld by the government if not by the order of a competent court and that any kind of warrant must be justified.  
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    Also, according to these laws, the laws show that a Filipino must only be prosecuted or sentenced by the judge that has the jurisdiction and that the detained person that is saved for the cases in this Constitution will be free on his or her request or the request of others. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">No citizen in the Philippines will be denied of his property and rights without the judicial sentence and the reason of necessity and utility. 
                    It also says that no one is needed to pay taxes that are not approved by the corporations that are authorized to urge people to pay the taxes. Also, as said in the articles, A Filipino who enjoyed the civil and political rights must not be prohibited from free exercises and that should not be denied of their rights and that the exercise of rights will be regulated. </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                      The crimes against the rights, according to this Constitution, must be penalized by the courts according to the laws, and also, the citizen can make and retain institutions and education according to the established prescriptions. Any Filipino and any foreigner can also freely live or work in Philippine territory without the certificates of aptitude and cannot be restricted from leaving the territory or transferring to another country even if he or she is not required for military or public charges. Any foreigner who is not regarded as a citizen can exercise any office in this country and every Filipino must be armed to protect the Motherland whenever he is called by the law. 
                    </p> 

                    <p class="text-justify">
                      The rights also must not suggest in prohibiting other rights that are not expressly stated and the former authorization will not be needed to accuse public officials before the lower courts for any committed offense. Also as said in this Constitution, the guaranteed provisions cannot be suspended for the whole Republic, however, it can be suspended temporarily and by law for the needs of the State security. 
                    </p> 

                    <p class="text-justify">
                      Lastly, no person in the Republic is brought to trial in courts and can have privileges that are not acquired as award for public service and no Filipino can establish institutions that involve property or accept honours, distinctions, or titles of nobility from foreign nations without the authorization of the Government. On the contrary, the nation will award under a special law the distinguished services provided by its citizens to the Motherland. 
                    </p> 

                    <b>Conclusion</b>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                      I have concluded that the Constitution in 1899 have made the regulations and rules of all of the actions and status of the Filipino citizens and the foreigners are travellers from other countries and the consequences of the violations and offenses against the laws. The Filipino must reside for 2 years and learn and understand to exercise the rights of the Pilipino and that he or she must learn to love and devote himself or herself to the country for its sake and welfare. The citizen has to understand and follow the laws and guidelines in the Philippines and its Constitution to reside in and support and honour the country for the better world and for the future. 
                    </p>
