                      A constitution is the supreme law of the land. It ensures that the state acts according to its existence. It is a codified law that determines the power of different bodies and individuals, and that citizens’ rights are upheld. It is very essential to making sure that everyone's interest and needs are addressed.  
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    In 1898, after the signing of Treaty of Paris in Washington D.C where the Philippines was sold to US for $20 million; Philippine insurgents who fought the Spanish rule immediately turn against the new occupiers. This led to the short Filipino-American War which results on U.S. losing more 10 times more troops suppressing the Philippines than in defeating Spain. In the end, our country was placed under military government but after the Spooner Amendment on 1901, which puts an end to military rule, we had a civil government, govern by William H. Taft. 
                    Here, the path to independence of the Philippines started and continued over the following years. Philippine Bill of 1902, which allows us to create lower legislative branch composed of Filipino legislators, the First Philippine Assembly in 1907; composed of educated Filipinos from respected clans such as Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osmeña, who revived the idea of immediate independence of Filipinos which was expressed by them personally sending missions to the US Congress.  
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    The Jones Law on 1916, which gave Filipinos the chance to govern themselves better. But controversy arose with the debate on the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill brought by Osmeña-Roxas in 1931, which provided for a 10-year transition period before the granting of Philippine independence. The independence bill resulted in the splitting of the Democratic Party and Nationalistic Party into two factions.  
                    Quezon eventually brought in, from the United States, the Tydings-McDuffie Act (Public Law 73-127) authored by Sen. Millard Tydings and Rep. John McDuffie, a revised version of what Osmeña-Roxas brought.  
                    The US approved a ten-year transition plan in 1934 and drafted a new constitution in 1935 but that plan was interrupted by Japanese invasion and World War II. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    The Commonwealth of the Philippines is established under President Manuel Quezon and the US promises independence in 10 years, it contains a political system that's very similar to the American one. The system called for a President to be elected at large for a 4-year term (subject to one re-election), a bicameral Congress, and an independent Judiciary. 

"The Filipino people, imploring the aid of Divine Providence, in order to establish a government that shall em­body their ideals, conserve and develop the patrimony of the nation, promote the general welfare, and secure to themselves and their posterity the blessings of independence under a régime of justice, liberty, and democracy, do ordain and promulgate this Constitution." 
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    The preamble of the Constitution of the Philippine Commonwealth, adopted by Constitutional Convention on Febuary 8, 1935, approved by the President of United States 43 days later, and finally ratified in a plebiscite of Filipino people. A part of constitution that sealed the Filipinos independence; a chance for them to govern themselves and became a one whole nation of their own. 
                    But what really is this Constitution? What will be the effect of it to the country? and how "independent" the Filipinos really are?  
                    The Philippines has had a total of six constitutions since the Proclamation of Independence on June 12, 1898. In 1899, the Malolos Constitution, the first Philippine Constitution—the first republican constitution in Asia—was drafted and adopted by the First Philippine Republic, which lasted from 1899 to 1901. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    During the American Occupation, the Philippines was governed by the laws of the United States of America. Organic Acts were passed by the United States Congress for the administration of the Government of the Philippine Islands. The first was the Philippine Organic Act of 1902, which provided for a Philippine Assembly composed of Filipino citizens. The second was the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916, which included the first pledge of Philippine independence.  
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    These laws served as constitutions of the Philippines from 1902 to 1935. In 1934, the United States Congress passed the Philippine Independence Act, which set the parameters for the creation of a constitution for the Philippines. The Act mandated the Philippine Legislature to call for an election of delegates to a Constitutional Convention to draft a Constitution for the Philippines. The 1934 Constitutional Convention finished its work on February 8, 1935.  
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    The Constitution was submitted to the President of the United States for certification on March 25, 1935. It was in accordance with the Philippine Independence Act of 1934. The 1935 Constitution was ratified by the Filipino people through a national plebiscite, on May 14, 1935 and came into full force and effect on November 15, 1935 with the inauguration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Among its provisions was that it would remain the constitution of the Republic of the Philippines once independence was granted on July 4, 1946. In 1940, the 1935 Constitution was amended by the National Assembly of the Philippines. The legislature was changed from a unicameral assembly to a bicameral congress. The amendment also changed the term limit of the President of the Philippines from six years with no reelection to four years with a possibility of being reelected for a second term. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    But did you know that for every change in the constitution in the Philippines, the President released a proclamation to commemorate the date when the new charter took effect? This day is called Constitution Day. Of all the constitutional changes the country went through, it's only the 1943 Constitution which did not have a corresponding proclamation. President Corazon C. Aquino, through Proclamation No. 211 of 1988, assigned February 2 of each year as Constitution Day to mark the new 1987 Constitution. How well do you know the supreme law of the land? We're listing down some vital information concerning one of the country's most important legal documents.

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    The 1973 Constitution, according to former Aquino spokesman Teodoro Locsin Jr, was never ratified as the process conducted by then president Ferdinand Marcos Jr met strong opposition. The Aquino government had 3 options with regard to the law of the land:

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    President Corazon Aquino in April 1986 created – through Proclamation No. 9 – the 1986 Constitutional Commission (ConCom), which was responsible for drafting a replacement for the 1973 Constitution. The new constitution, she said, should be “truly reflective of the aspirations and ideals of the Filipino people.”

                  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">
                  By the time of the presidency of Quezon in the Philippines, the country transportation and communication bad condition was uplifted. The Americans helped Quezon improve these by providing modern facilities needed for the fast delivery of the commodities and also for the Filipino people to lessen the hassles. Inter-island shipping was opened and railway lines were improved. Buses, vessels, cars and taxicabs increased in number, thus making the transportation accessible at relatively cheaper prices (Hamlin, 1954). 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">
                  Airports were also constructed under the Commonwealth government for more comfortable travel for the Filipinos as well as for faster transport of the goods. In terms of communication, wireless services of telephones were enhanced and radio broadcasting centers were opened. By the year 1940, Filipinos owning radio appliances were already more than 60 thousand (Jenkins, 1954). 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">
                    This was achieved through the: <b> Article XII Conservation and Utilization of Natural Resources.  Section 6:</b>

                    <b>The Improvement of Foreign Trade </b>
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    Before the establishment of the Commonwealth government in the country, the Filipinos had only less income when it comes to foreign trade. The country’s performance in foreign trade was very poor. With the help of the Americans, the Philippine foreign trade was improved. According to the statistics provided, the Philippine foreign trade rose to 530 million pesos from the amount of only 346 million pesos during pre-Commonwealth period (Hartendorp, 1953). Foreign trade was made more accessible by the Americans to the Filipinos by the reopening of the ports in Manila, Southern Luzon and even in the Muslim areas of Mindanao. 
                  </p>

                  <p>This was made possible with: <b>Article XVII the Commonwealth and the Republic. Section 5:  </b></p>

                    Upon the recommendation of President Quezon, the National Assembly created by the Americans under the Commonwealth government formed the National Economic Council. Its main purpose was to provide advices for the government on economic matters. Following to this was the reorganization of the National Development Economy to make it more efficient and responsive to the economic needs of the Filipino citizens (Hamlin, 1954). It also established State-owned National Food Products Corporation, the National Rice and Corn Corporation, and many more public companies. These companies aimed to protect the Filipinos from exploitation by producers and merchants (Jenkins, 1954).

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    The Commonwealth government made the public welfare a top priority for the Filipinos, so it strengthened the agencies responsible for the service. The Bureau of Public Welfare was pressured by the government to serve genuinely the people by being active most of the time about their conditions.

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    It also constructed the Associated Charities to do the same thing as much as it also called on the National Relief Administration to widely monitor the people in order to extend the scope of its service to the Filipino people specifically to those unfortunate Filipino citizens. The people with mental illnesses, poor and delinquent Filipino children were also reached by the Child Welfare Division to take care of them. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify"> On the other side of the American service, the jobless Filipinos were given part-time full-time jobs by the National Relief Administration aside the agency’s main service of distributing food to victims of natural calamities such as earthquakes, flooding, fires and many more. </p>

                    The Filipino women were not exempted in America’s effort in serving the Philippines. Women were given right to education, in contrast to the former colonization of the Spaniards that they were only treated as second class citizens, thus disallowing them to gain education access. As a result, many of the Filipino women became professionals. They were also part of building a better nation for the country.

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    The Commonwealth government encouraged the Filipinos to showcase their talents in arts and literature. They held contests for aspiring Filipino artists and writers. A contest in painting competed by the Filipinos was held under government auspices in 1936 (Grunder & Livezey, 1951). President Quezon established the Commonwealth Literary Contest in Tagalog, English, and Spanish upon the recommendation of the Philippine Writers League.

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    This was attained through the: <b>Article XIII General Provisions Section 5: </b>
                  </p>

The State shall create scholarships in arts, science, and letters for specially gifted citizens.” 
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    The 1935 Constitution played a huge role on expediting the modernization of the government in the Philippines. It provided the legal basis of the Commonwealth Government which was considered a transitional government before the Philippines have their total independence. With a constitution by America; the Philippine government eventually mold its government system after American government.
